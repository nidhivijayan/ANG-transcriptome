# ANG-transcriptome
Project proposal

Most eukaryotes maintain a symbiotic relationship with different prokaryotes; the term used to describe an entity encompassing both host and microbes is called holobionts. The evolution of holobionts may have originated in the sea (McFall-Ngai and Ruby, 2000). For example, animal multicellularity may have emerged from marine protists. Protists like choanoflagellates need a signaling cue produced by Bacteroidetes to switch from solitary to colonial animals (Alegado et al., 2012). The Hawaiian bobtail squid have two symbiotic organs, the light organ (LO) and the female-specific accessory nidamental gland (ANG). The nocturnal bobtail squid recruits bioluminescent *Vibrio fischeri* in a specialized light organ to counterilluminate against the moonlight as a defense mechanism. The mechanism of colonization and interaction between *E. scolopes* and *V. fischeri* has been well studied and is a model system for host-microbe interactions (Nyholm and McFall-Ngai, 2004). However, we don’t know how the ANG maintains a stable microbiome. 

The ANG is a reservoir for antimicrobial bacteria (Kerwin et al., 2019). It's hypothesized that mucopolysaccharides from the nidamental gland (NG) and bacteria from the ANG coat the fertilized eggs in multiple layers of jelly coats at the connection between the NG and ANG (Fig 1B, C). The difference in post-spawning care of the cephalopods with and without an ANG supports this hypothesis; Cephalopods that lack an ANG, like octopods and some pelagic squid, guard and aerate or brood their eggs (i.e. excessive post-spawning care) whereas squid and cuttlefish that possess an ANG provide little to no post-spawn care as they lay their eggs on a rocky substrate, cover it with sand and abandon their eggs. Furthermore, antibacterial and antifungal activities were observed in eggs and bacterial isolates from the ANG and eggs of Doryteuthis pealei (Barbieri et al. 1997), Uroteuthis duavaceli (Gomathi et al. 2010) and Euprymna scolopes (Gromek et al., 2016; Kerwin et al., 2019; Suria et al., 2020). Connections between the tubules containing bacteria and the nidamental gland were observed in Sepia pharaonis using histology (Huang et al., 2018).

The bobtail squid provides a unique system to study two stable symbiotic organs with different functions. Most animals, including humans, have different organs with different microbiomes; for example, gut, skin, and vaginal microbiome. However, their communities are dynamic and vary with several factors, making it difficult to study their effects on the host or how the host selects for them. The light organ of E. scolopes selectively maintains V. fischeri using various immune proteins like PGRPs and chemicals like halide peroxidase and nitric oxide, but we do not know the immune and metabolic response to bacteria in the ANG. 

We may use transcriptomics to understand what mechanisms the ANG uses to actively maintain and respond to bacteria. The genome of *E. scolopes* is 5.1 Mb, and has an N50 of 3,724kb with 35% gaps (Belcaid et al. 2019). This project will (1) compare the qualities of de novo and genome assembled ANG (n=8) and Light organ transcriptome (n=5) (2) analyze the pattern of differential expression between the ANG and LO from the de novo and genome assembled samples. If no significant difference is found, I will use the genome assembled transcriptomes for further analysis of the physiology of the ANG.
